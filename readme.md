# Shell script for exercises and learning:

When you running this shell script, bash will provide the number 88 in a loop. After you understand what shell scripting is you will never run a bash script again without first looking in to the source. The changge you run a virus is huge! Thats the lesson. 

Download install.sh and make it executable (chmod +x install.sh), and then run it (./install.sh). This script will continuously output the number 88 in the terminal until you stop it (you can stop it by pressing Ctrl+C)

Single install command:

```
bash <(curl -L raw.githubusercontent.com/ramackersjp/install-script/main/install.sh)
```
