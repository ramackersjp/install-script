Download install.sh and make it executable (chmod +x install.sh), and then run it (./install.sh). This script will continuously output the number 88 in the terminal until you stop it (you can stop it by pressing Ctrl+C)

Single install command:

```

bash <(curl -L githubusercontent.com/ramackersjp/install-script/main/install.sh)
```
